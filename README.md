Python scraper to extract and export 2017 Czech parliamentary election results by district.

# Election Results Scraper ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿

This project is a Python script that scrapes election results for selected districts (okrsky) from the official Czech election website (https://www.volby.cz) for the 2017 parliamentary elections.

## How it works

You run the script with two arguments:

1. A valid election result URL (e.g. for Kladno, KutnÃ¡ Hora, or MÄ›lnÃ­k)
2. The name of the CSV file where the results will be saved

### Usage example

```bash
python main.py <URL> <output_file.csv>
```

Example for KutnÃ¡ Hora:

```bash
python main.py https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps32?xjazyk=CZ&xkraj=2&xnumnuts=2105 vysledky_kutna_hora.csv
```

## Processed districts

- [Kladno](https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps311?xjazyk=CZ&xkraj=2&xnumnuts=2103)
- [KutnÃ¡ Hora](https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps311?xjazyk=CZ&xkraj=2&xnumnuts=2105)
- [MÄ›lnÃ­k](https://www.volby.cz/pls/ps2017nss/ps311?xjazyk=CZ&xkraj=2&xnumnuts=2106)
